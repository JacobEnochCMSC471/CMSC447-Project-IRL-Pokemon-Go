# CMSC447-Project-IRL-Pokemon-Go
A project that consists of 5 iterations of an agile development cycle. 

### Current Release: v0.2.0-prealpha 

### FOR TESTING:
* Change directory to outer PGIRL directory ...\PGIRL -> `python manage.py test` in terminal to run the tests
* One test in \PGIRL\Photo_Uploader\tests.py fails because I'm still unsure about how to make the client POST correctly for the image upload form. 
* As far as we know no special configurations must be made to have the software run
* Run instructions: Simply change directory via terminal to the top-level PGIRL directory and type `python manage.py runserver` to run the server. Click IP address in console to connect.
* Photo_Uploader functionality can be found at /image_upload - still need to implement ways to access pages via buttons or links on the site
